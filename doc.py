    f'In Telegram you can easily export your chat history.' \
    f'I can only work with personal chats for now, so please pick one' \
    f'and let\'s analyze it! Here is an official guide on how to' \
    f'get a file with your history ' \
    f'(https://telegram.org/blog/export-and-more).' \
    f'Please note, this feature available only from Desktop App. Remember' \
    f'to save in .json format, not in .html.\n\n' \
    f'2. How it works.\n' \
    f'After you done with exporting desired history - ' \
    f'we ready to go. Just attach "result.json" file to a regular message and send' \
    f'it to me. I\'ll try to do my best analyzing it for you and send back some plots.' \

    f'but if you worry about it you can consider next step.\n\n' \
    f'3. You should feel free to delete essential ' \
    f'parts of your messaging history before sending it to me, like messages text, user id, etc.\n' \
    f'I\'ll try to stay functional. ' \
    f'But there is recommended set of messages params ' \
    f'to be present in your json: id, type, date, from, media_type. ' \
